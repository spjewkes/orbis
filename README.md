# Orbis

Orbis a simple application for exploring 3D worlds. To begin with the project will aim to create a very simplistic Minecraft type environment but may change as the project develops.

The main idea of this project is to extend the simple OpenGL example I wrote last year and try to break the code into classes that can be duplicated to allow multiple objects in an environment.
